# clavis-mortis

Clavis mortis is a simple game where you, the player, are a creepy mischievous disembodied head.
your goal in the game is to find your way to the final door of each level often through other doors with poorly secured code locks thanks to John who cannot remember any codes so his coworkers must leave them for him on notes you may find on bookshelves or other objects.

### Disclamer

Currently there is only a single level demo for the game which contains the basics of playing the game (doors codes and multiple layers)

## How to play

to move around in the game you sue the W, A, S, and D keys
to interact with a tile such as a door you simply attempt to move into it

## Running from source code

to run this game from source code you will need to have a the `PySide6` package installed with pip.
if you are missing anything when you run the file it will tell you what is missing
